        <p>Exercising regularly, every day if possible, 
            is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, 
            exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, 
            it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers.</p>

        <h2>What are the best types of exercise?</h2>
        <p>While there are endless forms of exercise, experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. <br>

            Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. <br>
            Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body, the main focus is on your heart and lungs (Aerobic exercise is often called ‚Äúcardio‚Äù because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system) <br>
             Activities like walking, swimming, dancing and cycling, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working <br>
             Aerobic exercises burn fat, improve your mood, reduce inflammation and lower blood <br>
            
            Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, should be performed two to three times a week. Squats, lunges, push-ups and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. <br>
            Strength training also helps prevent falls, keep bones strong, lower blood sugar levels, and improve <br>
             Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises, such as doing planks and holding leg lifts, are done without movement. <br>
             They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. <br>
             Bicep curls, bench presses and sit-ups are all forms of isotonic <br>
            
            Stretching exercises keep your muscles and tendons flexible, preserve your posture, and improve mobility, especially as you <br>
             Stretching can be done every day.
            
            Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented, such as those of the inner ear, vision and muscles and <br>
             Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years.</p>
             <h2>How much exercise do I need?</h2>

             <p>How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors,<br>
                 including your current level of fitness, your fitness goals, the types of exercise you‚Äôre planning to do, <br>
                  and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength, flexibility or balance.

                As a general rule, 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) <br>
                 is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit, you‚Äôll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum <br>
                  A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30-minute session five times per week, or you can break it up and do two 15-minute sessions during a single <br>
                   Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle.</p>
